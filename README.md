Instructions: In VS Code, or an IDE of your choice, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below. Ensure that the code compiles and runs as directed. Take screenshots of the code and of the running program (make sure to get screenshots of all required functionality) and paste them in this document where instructed below. Create a new repository on GitHub for this week’s assignments and push this document, with your JavaScript project code, to the repository. Add the URL for this week’s repository to this document where instructed and submit this document to your instructor when complete.
Coding Steps:
1.	Using any of the tools you’ve worked with so far, create a game of tic-tac-toe.
a.	A heading should say whether it is X’s or O’s turn and change with each move made.
b.	Create a tic-tac-toe grid using your HTML element of choice. When a cell in the grid is clicked, an X or O should appear in that spot depending on whose turn it is.
c.	A button should be available to clear the grid and restart the game.
d.	When a player has won, or the board is full and the game results in a draw, a Bootstrap alert or similar Bootstrap component should appear across the screen announcing the winner.
